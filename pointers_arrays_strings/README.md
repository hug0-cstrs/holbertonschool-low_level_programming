# Pointers, arrays and strings
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in `C language`.<br>
- A pointer is a special variable that can contain the address of another variable. other variable.
- In C, each pointer is limited to one data type. It can contain the address of a simple variable of this type or the address of a component of an array of this type.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
