# Argc, argv

Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about how to use arguments passed to a program in `C language`.

`argc` is the number of arguments on the command line (including the program name itself)
`argv` is an array of C-style strings (character arrays, with a null character at the end of each string) argv[0] is the name of the program being executed.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :
