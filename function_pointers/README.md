# Function pointers
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about function pointers in `C language`.<br>
A function pointer, also called a subroutine pointer or procedure pointer, is a pointer that points to a function. Unlike referencing a data value, a function pointer points to executable code in memory.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-print_name.c`|Prints a name|
|`1-array_iterator.c`|Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array|
|`2-int_index.c`|Searches for an integer|
|`3-calc.h`|Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures|
|`3-op_functions.c`|File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations|
|`3-get_op_func.c`|Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions|
