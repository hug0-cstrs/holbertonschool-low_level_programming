# Low-level programming & Algorithm
Wat is lower level in programming?

A low-level language is the language the machine understands. The machine language. Every machine or computer comes with a specific assembly.  Low level languages are used to write programs that relate to the specific architecture and hardware of a particular type of computer.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|[`hello_world`](https://github.com/hug0-cstrs/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/hello_world)|It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language|
|[`variables_if_else_while`](https://github.com/hug0-cstrs/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/variables_if_else_while)|It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in C language|
|[`functions_nested_loops`](https://github.com/hug0-cstrs/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/functions_nested_loops)|It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in C language|
|[`more_functions_nested_loops`](https://github.com/hug0-cstrs/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/more_functions_nested_loops)|It aims to learn about nested loops in C language|
