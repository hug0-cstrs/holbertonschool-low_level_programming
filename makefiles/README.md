# Makefiles
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn what are makefiles, when, why and how to use them (with variables, explicit and implicit rules).

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-Makefile`|Builds an executable with `all` rule|
|`1-Makefile`|Builds an executable specifying a compiler and source files (`CC` and `SRC` variables)|
|`2-Makefile`|Builds an executable using `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ` and `NAME` variables|
|`3-Makefile`|Builds an executable using `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean` and `re` rules, and `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME` and `RM` variables|
|`4-Makefile`|Builds an executable using `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean` and `re` rules, and `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM` and `CFLAGS` variables|
|`100-Makefile`|Complete Makefile with all of the variables and rules previously mentioned|
