# Malloc, free
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about automatic and dynamic allocation in `C language`.<br>
Malloc is a function in the standard C library that allows you to dynamically allocate memory. The release of the memory thus reserved is done with the free function. This function is declared in the <stdlib.h> header.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-create_array.c`|Creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char|
|`1-strdup.c`|Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter|
|`2-str_concat.c`|Concatenates two strings|
|`3-alloc_grid.c`|Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers|
|`4-free_grid.c`|Frees a 2 dimensional grid previously allocated in the heap memory|
|`5-argstostr.c`|Concatenates all the arguments of a program|
