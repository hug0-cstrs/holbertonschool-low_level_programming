# More malloc, free
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about how to use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `exit` functions in `C language`.<br>
`Malloc` is a function in the `standard C library` that allows you to dynamically allocate memory. The release of the memory thus reserved is done with the `free` function. This function is declared in the `<stdlib.h>` header.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-malloc_checked.c`|Allocates memory using `malloc`|
|`1-string_nconcat.c`|Concatenates two strings|
|`2-calloc.c`|Allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`|
|`3-array_range.c`|Creates an array of integers|
