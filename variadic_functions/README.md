# Variadic functions
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about variadic functions in `C language`<br>
A variadic function is a function of indefinite arity, i.e. it accepts a variable number of parameters.
Many mathematical and logical operations can be represented as variadic functions.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-sum_them_all.c`|Returns the sum of all its parameters|
|`1-print_numbers.c`|Prints numbers|
|`2-print_strings.c`|Prints strings|
|`3-print_all.c`|Prints anything|
