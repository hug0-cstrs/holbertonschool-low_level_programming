# Recursion
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about recursion and how to implement it in `C language`.<br>
Recursion is a method of describing algorithms that allows a function to call itself

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-puts_recursion.c`|Prints a string|
|`1-print_rev_recursion.c	`|Prints a string in reverse|
|`2-strlen_recursion.c`|Returns the length of a string|
|`3-factorial.c`|Returns the factorial of a given number|
|`4-pow_recursion.c`|Returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`|
|`5-sqrt_recursion.c`|Returns the natural sqaure root of a number|
|`6-is_prime_number.c`|Returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`|
