# Structures, typedef
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about structures and typedef in `C language`<br>

A structure is a user-defined data type in C / C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group elements of possibly different types into a single type.

Typedef is a reserved keyword in the programming languages C, C++. It is used to create an additional name (alias) for another data type, but does not create a new type.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`dog.h`|Header file that contains a `struct dog`|
|`1-init_dog.c`|Initialize a variable of type `struct dog`|
|`2-print_dog.c`|Prints a `struct dog`|
|`3-islower.c`|Checks for lowercase character|
|`4-new_dog.c`|Creates a new dog|
|`5-free_dog.c`|Frees a dog|
