# Functions, nested loops
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in `C language`.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-putchar.c`|Prints `putchar`|
|`1-alphabet.c`|Prints the alphabet in lowercase|
|`2-print_alphabet_x10.c`|Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase|
|`3-islower.c`|Checks for lowercase character|
|`4-isalpha.c`|Checks for alphabetic character|
|`5-sign.c`|Prints the sign of a number|
|`6-abs.c`|Computes the absolute value of an integer|
|`7-print_last_digit.c`|Prints the last digit of a number|
|`8-24_hours.c`|Prints every minute of the day|
|`9-times_table.c`|Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0|
|`10-add.c`|Adds two integers and returns the result|
|`11-print_to_98.c`|Prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`|
